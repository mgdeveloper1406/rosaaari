        <p>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather
        that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the
        crowd, saying, &ldquo;I am innocent of this righteous man&rsquo;s blood;
        see to it yourselves.&rdquo; And all the people answered,
        &ldquo;His blood be on us and on our children!&rdquo; Then
        he released for them Barab&prime;bas, and having scourged Jesus,
        delivered him to be crucified.</p>
