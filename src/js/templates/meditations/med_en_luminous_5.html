        <p>Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and
        broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this
        is my body.&rdquo; And he took a cup, and when he had given
        thanks he gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you;
        for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out
        for many for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
