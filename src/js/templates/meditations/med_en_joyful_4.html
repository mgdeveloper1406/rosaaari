        <p>Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose
        name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the
        consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
        And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he
        should not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ.
        And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and
        when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to
        the custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and
        blessed God and said,</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,<br>
        according to thy word;<br>
        for mine eyes have seen thy salvation<br>
        which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br>
        a light for revelation to the Gentiles,<br>
        and for glory to thy people Israel.&rdquo;</blockquote>
