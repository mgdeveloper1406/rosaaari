        <p>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill
        country, to a city of Judah, and she entered the house of
        Zechari&prime;ah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth
        heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth
        was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a
        loud cry, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit
        of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother
        of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of
        your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.
        And blessed is she who believed that there would be a
        fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.&rdquo;
